# LlamaIndex MCP Experiment

In this project, I’m experimenting with **LlamaIndex** and exploring how to integrate an MCP host with it.

You’re welcome to try it out:

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server

Start the SQL MCP server. You can either:

- **Run it directly:**

  ```bash
  python sql_mcp_server.py
  ```


*(Note: Depending on your environment, e.g., PyCharm, running as a module may work better.)*

## Running the Main Script

After starting the server, run:

```bash
python main.py
```
